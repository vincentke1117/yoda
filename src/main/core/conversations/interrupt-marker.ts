/**
 * In-memory "the user interrupted this conversation" markers.
 *
 * Needed because a Claude transcript can freeze in a `working` shape with no
 * way to ever leave it: a turn killed before its first assistant output (app
 * restart, Esc before any output — CC writes no interrupt sentinel and fires
 * no Stop hook in that window). The stateless `deriveStatus` and the live
 * transcript tailer would both re-derive `working` from that frozen transcript
 * forever, defeating any force-clear of the in-memory store.
 *
 * A marker says: transcript-`working` verdicts are stale for this conversation
 * unless the decisive prompt row is NEWER than the marker. A new user prompt
 * (decisive row after the marker) invalidates the marker automatically, so the
 * next real turn spins normally.
 *
 * Keyed by conversation id alone (UUIDs — globally unique) so the transcript
 * tailer, which doesn't know project/task, can consult it too.
