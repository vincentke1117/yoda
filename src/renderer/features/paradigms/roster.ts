/**
 * A paradigm as a roster of Agents, in both directions.
 *
 * A paradigm is a way of working, and a way of working is a set of Agents — one
 * for vibe coding, three for a review pipeline. The kinds store that set two
 * different ways for historical reasons (`single` in a fixed seat, `team` in a
 * members array), which is why "add another Agent" used to be impossible in one
 * of them and the user had to pick a category up front.
 *
 * These functions make the roster the single thing the configuration UI edits and
 * let the kind fall out of its size: one Agent is a `single` paradigm, two or more
 * is a `team`. Nobody has to be told.
 *
 * This lives in the renderer because reading a seat into a member needs the Agent
 * rows and the composer draft — the seat only stores an id.
