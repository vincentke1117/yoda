/**
 * Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) — the GENERAL way agents collaborate in a
 * Team Room, independent of any one workflow. Agents talk to the room out-of-band
 * by running the `team-at` / `team-status` scripts (they POST to Yoda's hook
 * server), NOT by writing @handles or markers into their normal output. The
 * conductor injects whatever a member is told into that member's live session —
 * so "@ing" a teammate is literally continuing its agent session with new input,
 * which every CLI supports.
 *
 * Specific collaboration MODES build on this: e.g. the review loop (implement ↔
 * review) lives in `review-protocol.ts`, fan-out and freeform are other modes.
 * Review is just one typical mode — this protocol is the substrate they share.
