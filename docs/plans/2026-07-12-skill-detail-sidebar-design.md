# Skill detail sidebar

## Goal

Make repeated skill browsing faster without duplicating the catalog or skill actions inside the detail page.

## Design

Use a master-detail layout at wide container sizes. A compact 240px navigation rail sits to the left of the existing detail content. It inherits the catalog tab that opened the detail, so an installed detail lists only installed skills and a recommended detail lists only recommendations. It contains a sticky search field and a dense alphabetical list. The active skill uses the existing neutral selected background plus a narrow leading rail, so selection remains visible without introducing a new accent system.

Selecting a skill uses the existing skill-tab navigation. An already-open detail is focused and a new skill opens as a deduplicated detail tab, preserving Yoda's established comparison model. Installation, disablement, editing, and other entity actions remain in the shared detail components.

Right-clicking another skill offers a focused comparison action. It pins that skill detail into Yoda's existing shell side pane while leaving the current detail in the main area, producing a real side-by-side view without introducing a second comparison state model.

At narrow container widths the rail is hidden and the existing detail layout remains unchanged. The app tab strip continues to provide navigation in that constrained host.

## Verification

- Search matches display name, directory ID, and description.
- Current skill is exposed with `aria-current`.
- The rail responds to its actual host width through a container query.
- Existing skill tabs remain the source of truth for opening and comparison.
