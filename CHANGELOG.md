# Changelog

## 0.16.0

### Added

- Manage larger skill libraries with catalog tabs, a detail navigation sidebar, full-content diffs, logical variant grouping, install-location visibility, and reusable project harness snapshots.
- Manage workspaces and archived tasks from their dedicated dialogs and project menus.
- Automatically persist and reuse delivery summaries so resumed work keeps the latest handoff context.

### Changed

- Simplify Yoda Mobile Relay setup around the canonical LovStudio pairing domain, with clearer retry, reconnect, account-recovery, and copyable error flows.
- Keep terminal file links anchored to their original source locations across wrapped, indented, hyphenated, spaced, and list-separated paths.

### Fixed

- Retry GitHub pull-request branch fetches over authenticated HTTPS when an SSH connection on port 443 closes unexpectedly.
- Allow untracked files during worktree provisioning while continuing to block tracked local changes.
- Preserve native Windows worktree containment checks and POSIX paths for SSH projects, while returning renderer-facing relative paths with consistent forward slashes.
- Pass Claude settings through a protected temporary file only for local Windows sessions, retain inline settings for SSH, preserve theme and skill overrides, and clean temporary artifacts on every session exit path.
- Keep Codex notification hooks connected to the current Yoda endpoint after a main-process restart on Windows.
- Preserve Relay responses under backpressure and recover cleanly from offline reconnects and mobile connection failures.

## 0.15.11

### Added

- Sign in to Yoda with a LovStudio account and view account, credit, Relay Pass, and device status in the desktop app.
- Connect Yoda Mobile across different networks through Yoda Relay without requiring Tailscale or the same LAN.
- Start a seven-day Relay trial, activate a prepaid Relay Pass with LovStudio credits, and revoke paired devices from the shared account system.

### Changed

- Use LovStudio as the account and billing control plane for Yoda CLI authentication and Relay authorization.

## 0.15.10

### Fixes

- Run the signed Sparkle delta installation smoke test through the same closed local proxy used by the packaged application.

## 0.15.9

### Fixes

- Preserve the `.delta` extension through the local Sparkle proxy so signed incremental updates can be extracted and installed instead of falling back to a blocked full update.

## 0.15.8

### Fixes

- Prevent Sparkle from rejecting a valid signed delta because of brittle executable-size or localization eligibility hints.

## 0.15.7

### Patch Changes

- Keep the Home comparison action available while a restored project is still mounting, and allow projectless comparison rows to select their base project.

## 0.15.6

### Patch Changes

- Publish architecture-qualified Sparkle delta assets so Apple Silicon and Intel updates cannot overwrite each other.

## 0.15.5

### Patch Changes

- Keep Codex quota and reset-credit status isolated per account and visible while live usage refreshes.
- Redeem available Codex reset credits from the account usage surfaces.
- Prevent the Home comparison controls from disappearing when the packaged app restores a projectless or still-opening draft.

## 0.15.4

### Patch Changes

- Keep default tasks projectless and preserve the correct projectless icon option when creating a task.
- Refresh live Codex account usage in the workspace runtime bar and account settings panel.

## 0.15.3

### Patch Changes

- Regenerate macOS DMG blockmaps and update metadata after notarization so published checksums and sizes match the final stapled artifacts.

## 0.15.2

### Patch Changes

- Start development reliably after a clean Electron 42 install by resolving its lazy-downloaded runtime before electron-vite launches.
- Keep project merge and workspace reorder updates inside synchronous database transactions to avoid partial state changes.

## 0.15.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix the Electron runtime crash on macOS 26 by upgrading Electron and the native rebuild chain.

All notable changes to Yoda will be documented in this file.

The public Yoda changelog starts at **0.1.0**. Earlier non-Yoda release history
is preserved in git tags only.

## 0.15.0 — 2026-07-10

### Added

- Runtime chrome now surfaces prompt count, live context usage, and session
  history access directly in the workspace bar.
- Workspace shell and runtime snapshot plumbing add first-class in-app runtime
  management and dependency visibility.
- Task and conversation flows now track richer session prompt context for
  resumed runs.

### Changed

- Agent selector and runtime settings tighten the display for current
  runtime/account usage and related controls.
- Sidebar and task surfaces were reorganized around the new runtime history and
  prompt context affordances.

### Fixed

- Conversations resume reliably after PTY restarts and duplicate resume
  requests are coalesced.
- Task sidebar click targets and overlap issues were cleaned up, along with PTY
  resize freeze regressions.

## 0.14.5 — 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- Releases: refresh the China CDN root update manifests after uploading mirror
  assets so macOS and Linux update feeds move to the new version immediately.

## 0.14.4 — 2026-07-09

### Added

- Tasks: support moving SSH-backed task worktrees between projects through a
  git-bundle shuttle, keeping remote tasks first-class across project moves.
- Skills: add search to the skill shortcut menu so large local skill catalogs
  are easier to filter from the composer.

### Changed

- Home: make the run-host selector interactive and show SSH-backed projects as
  available instead of a disabled coming-soon state.
- Sidebar: simplify the multi-agent task marker while keeping team-room tasks
  visually distinct from normal task rows.

### Fixed

- Conversations: deferred prompt injection now waits for the live PTY to be
  ready before sending the queued prompt.
- Skills: fix shortcut menu clipping so filtered results remain usable in the
  popup.

## 0.14.3 — 2026-07-06

### Added

- Releases: mirror production installers, blockmaps, and updater manifests to
  the China CDN at `cdn.cs-magic.cn/yoda`.
- Settings: add an update source selector so packaged builds can check and
  download updates from the China mirror when GitHub is unreliable.
- Website: add China mirror download links for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### Changed

- Release CI now embeds the configured China mirror feed URL into production
  builds and uploads mirror artifacts when the `release` environment secrets are
  available.

## 0.14.2 — 2026-07-06

### Added

- Agent runtime: add a login/re-login action in the account panel for switching
  official runtime subscriptions.
- Pull requests: seed review tasks with richer fix context so spawned agent work
  starts with PR title, URL, branch, description, and changed-file metadata.
- Sessions: add regressions for archived task session recovery.

### Changed

- Prompt rewrite now fails open during task submission so agent startup can
  continue with the original prompt when rewrite preprocessing fails.
- Session recovery now resolves moved Codex resume sessions and keeps archived
  task sessions findable after project path changes.
- Worktree provisioning no longer stalls on stale worktree directories.

### Fixed

- File watcher: move ignored-directory filtering out of `@parcel/watcher` native
  glob handling and into JavaScript to avoid Windows native crashes on long
  paths.
- Packaging: include `zod` as a runtime dependency so packaged builds can load
  `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` from `app.asar`.

## 0.14.1 — 2026-07-02

### Added

- Agent rooms: support member identity editing, photo avatars, relative room
  times, and configurable routing hop limits.
- Projects: add issue and pull request overview surfaces, project path move
  flows, repo path actions, and issue-based task intake actions.
- Tasks: add AI rename suggestion flows and docked session history previews.

### Changed

- Composer: reuse the shared prompt input implementation across renderer
  surfaces.
- Terminal: persist drawer state, improve resize hit areas, and make renderer
  fallback behavior explicit.

### Fixed

- Projects: recover Codex sessions after path merges and stop agents before
  moving project paths.
- Terminal: improve hard-wrapped URL link detection, restore stable WebGL
  rendering, and support macOS Option-arrow navigation.

## 0.14.0 — 2026-07-01

### Added

- Account: support a local nickname override and show the updated display name
  across account surfaces.

### Changed

- Settings: simplify the account panel, hide the username in the account
  summary, and move sign out into account actions.

## 0.13.11 — 2026-06-30

### Added

- Generated task outputs can now skip language post-processing when no rewrite
  is desired.

### Changed

- Language operations now default to disabled for generated task outputs.
- Composer language controls are simpler, and disabled language selectors are no
  longer shown.

## 0.13.10 — 2026-06-30

### Added

- Projects: a project overview surface with usage columns, customizable
  overview columns, archive/view actions, and sidebar quick actions.
- Composer and settings: per-agent permission mode controls, project language
  overrides, input prompt language overrides, global LLM configuration, and LLM
  profile settings.
- MaaS: ZenMux usage entry points, a usage modal, provider info snapshots, AI
  Gateway model discovery, model candidate sorting, and model picker controls.
- Tasks and worktrees: move worktree tasks across projects, search move targets,
  drag sidebar projects, and order move targets by sidebar order.

### Changed

- Settings: LLM and MaaS configuration now use clearer panel sections and
  chapter-style controls.
- Terminal: embedded terminals can use the canvas renderer.

### Fixed

- Composer and home: permission and branch controls stay stable inside popovers,
  and system prompt controls are scoped to agent CLI settings.
- Settings: row controls stay inline, IME composition is guarded in LLM inputs,
  and LLM debug failures expose copyable details.
- MaaS: API key masks, ZenMux console routes, usage stats, and toolbar layout are
  corrected.
- Tasks and worktrees: empty context items are clearer, and moving worktree tasks
  into non-git targets reports copyable errors.

## 0.13.9 — 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- Conversations: Claude's TUI theme now follows the embedded terminal
  background, keeping its menus readable on a light terminal.
- Agent rooms: the composer auto-sizes to its content.
- Home: attached boundary images no longer degrade to plain text after the
  message is sent.
- Deep links: archived-conversation deep links are handled, and a running dev
  build no longer steals Yoda deep links from the installed app.
- Codex: untitled sessions resolve correctly on resume.

## 0.13.8 — 2026-06-23

### Added

- Agent rooms: a live per-agent status label in the room header.

### Fixed

- Agent rooms: keep the composer footer visible in group chat.
- PTY: network proxy variables (`HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY`) are
  now always passed to the agent environment, independent of the API-key
  passthrough setting — so agents still reach the network through your proxy
  even when API-key passthrough is disabled or scoped to specific keys.

## 0.13.6 — 2026-06-20

### Added

- Move (promote) a task to another project.
- Conversation panel: markdown links are now clickable.

### Changed

- The internal Drafts project is renamed and rendered as a normal project row
  in the sidebar.
- Embedded browser tames audio: autoplay is controlled, with mute / auto-mute.

## 0.13.5 — 2026-06-19

### Changed

- Multi-config comparison polish: all config rows are unified — the base config
  is migrated into the list alongside variants, every row carries its own config
  gear, rows can be dragged to reorder, and the "+对比" button sits
  right-aligned at the end of the first row instead of on a separate line.

## 0.13.4 — 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Multi-config comparison**: a "+对比" button under the composer adds variant
  rows that each override project, runtime/model, branch strategy, or prompt.
  Submitting spawns one task per config and tiles them side by side in a
  detached window with a columns/rows toggle; closing the window leaves every
  task in its project sidebar.

### Changed

- The agent-only "compare" run mode is replaced by the general multi-config
  comparison above (persisted `compare` run mode is coerced for back-compat).
- Compare controls: the 对比 button sits after the settings gear, the gear is
  labeled, and chip labels collapse responsively when space is tight.

## 0.13.3 — 2026-06-18

### Added

- An agent's configured model is now applied at launch, via a per-runtime model
  flag.
- Smart paths recognize trailing-slash inputs as directories.

### Fixed

- Deep links: opening a task target mounts its project (no more white screen),
  and the main window is focused instead of an arbitrary one.
- Claude / Codex no longer get stuck "awaiting input" (the PTY classifier is no
  longer wired for them).
- Terminal: no duplicate/ghost lines while scrolling; the file-link hover hint
  is delayed to 2s.

## 0.13.2 — 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- Updater: surface update failures, with a manual-download fallback and proxy
  support.

## 0.13.1 — 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- Agent rooms: ensure a session's conversation is loaded before opening its tab.

## 0.13.0 — 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Agent Teams — multi-agent collaboration**: a new paradigm where a team of
  agents collaborates in a shared room. Teams are decoupled templates (data +
  domain + RPC) managed in the Library, drive the 多智能体 paradigm from the
  composer, and run as an iterative conductor room. Includes a built-in
  "Review" team, a game-loop conductor (`@mention` injects into a session,
  team-@ callbacks), a System referee that auto-routes turns, generic
  @-mention routing, a persistent clickable roster, an inline/resizable session
  inspector, heartbeat + standup progress, and the team group chat surfaced in
  the task Overview tab. Review is surfaced in both the Workflow and
  Multi-agent sections; Agent Teams get their own Multi-agent sidebar entries.
- **Annotations**: select text in markdown / session-context docs / file
  viewers to attach notes, each anchored to its file path and source line, and
  sync them into the session input.
- **Prompt library**: a built-in leaked-system-prompts reference gallery;
  leaked prompts become reusable atomic principles; system + per-project
  layered prompt principles with drag-to-reorder and an accordion (百叶窗) view.
- **New runtimes**: GLM (Zhipu, via z.ai), Step (StepFun), and xAI Grok Build
  CLI — bringing the client lineup to 31.
- **Composer dual-layer config**: project/global layering for base branch,
  reviewer, compare, and review strategy; collapsible run-defaults; surfaced
  saved prompt templates; `attachImagesAsPaths`.
- Home: redesigned agent slot card (brand monogram avatar, ghost agent picker,
  compact hierarchy); a docked session-history strip; alt-click pins or hosts a
  task/project in the global side pane.

### Changed

- **Terminology**: user-facing copy renames Runtime → 客户端 (client) and
  Agent → 智能体; code symbols are unchanged.
- **Settings restructured**: iOS-style `SettingRow` (label + control on line 1,
  full-width description on line 2, normalized control heights); tmux promoted
  into its own tab / Terminal-tab chapter; Library nav collapses to a dropdown
  when narrow.
- The team verdict flows through a structured ACP hook instead of PTY-marker
  scraping; a shared `AgentCard` is reused across surfaces.

### Fixed

- Team rooms: stop an infinite loop/crash from system lines re-entering
  routing; deterministic, round-capped review loop; agents post start/finish
  status in their own voice; `ptyId` baked into per-member scripts.
- PTY: avoid tmux "command too long" for large system prompts; composer no
  longer freezes when inserting a large prompt template.
- Restore archived conversations when un-archiving a task; un-stick Claude
  awaiting-input via authoritative status.

## 0.12.1 — 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Review mode, first usable cut**: one reviewer session is reused across
  rounds, the reviewer's hand-off note is forwarded (not the raw buffer), the
  reviewer conversation loads into the store before opening side-by-side, and
  the reviewer sidebar opens at half width.
- **Team rooms (phase 1)**: rooms / members / messages data layer, domain, and
  RPC (internal groundwork; not yet user-facing).

### Changed

- tmux detection splits into a Terminal settings tab, with the toggle kept in
  Sessions; the tmux status row aligns with the dependency-status UI language.

### Fixed

- Review: no more false PASS from the reviewer prompt echo; the prompt-submit
  delay is floored so injected feedback actually sends.

## 0.12.0 — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Library**: a new top-level nav surface consolidating Prompts, Skills, and
  Automation, with MCP and Agents moved in alongside them — Settings now keeps
  only configuration. Atomic prompt principles are surfaced in the Prompts
  section.
- **Boot fast-path for returning launches**: returning launches show the
  logo-only mark and auto-enter, skipping the kernel-boot animation (gated to
  first run only), with a mac-style progress bar on the centered mark.
- The Enable-tmux settings row surfaces tmux detection details.

### Fixed

- Boot seeds common bin dirs into PATH before any spawn.
- Sidebar no longer scroll-snaps back to the active row on row refresh; the
  caret lands at the end of a prefilled archive command.

## 0.11.5 — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Antigravity CLI** runtime provider.
- A manual refresh button on the token usage card.

### Fixed

- Usage recovers for sessions whose worktree was pruned.
- The token-usage refresh spinner holds for a perceptible minimum.
- Split view scopes beside-panes to their primary task.

## 0.11.4 — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Compare/team on unborn repos**: an initial commit is seeded so compare and
  team modes work on empty or non-git project folders; all candidates tile side
  by side on launch.
- **Branch rail**: the sidebar shows a per-branch edge bar (tinted by a stable
  per-branch hue) instead of a suffix in compact mode, and signals
  worktree-based sessions.
- Undo toast after archiving a task; Docs is always offered in the "+" menu and
  guides configuration on open.

### Fixed

- **Per-task chrome state is now scoped per task**: sidebar / bottom-panel /
  panel-group state and the bottom drawer no longer sync or bleed across tasks;
  task sidebar state stays runtime-only; statusline scopes to the project root.
- Split view: hosted panes render their own tab strip (the global app-tab strip
  is hidden), and PTY sessions resume in extra panes so sending works.
- PTY: the wheel scrolls scrollback under mouse tracking, with sticky-bottom on
  return.
- Compare mode works on a non-git project folder; initial-commit stats no
  longer block the create action and surface the real git error on failure.
- Codex: prompt principles are passed as developer instructions.
- Workspace switcher popup closes after selecting a workspace; only main-branch
  tasks are marked, not every fork.

## 0.11.3 — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Installed-plugin manager** alongside skills, with a prominent header tab
  control switching between Skills and Plugins (styled as native app tab chips).
- Project view defaults to overview-only tabs, with on-demand pages and a Docs
  view.
- Workspace footer badge counts review-needed tasks and swaps to a gear on
  hover.

### Changed

- The archive command pre-fills the full skill instead of stitching it in the
  background; the archive submenu is removed from the task menu.

## 0.11.2 — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **Quick project creation**: the project selector can create a project on the
  fly — auto-deriving the path and initializing the repo — via a prompt-titled
  dialog.
- **Review workflow**: review orchestration moves into the main process with a
  marker turn-end fallback; new review sessions auto-activate and display side
  by side with the implementer by default.
- Conversations: archived conversations fold into the unified list with
  consistent sorting and a "finished" style; the session-exit banner becomes a
  floating frosted "shutdown" command bar with one-click debug-info copy.
- Tasks: "add parent task" (a session-less grouping container) via a
  name-input dialog defaulting to the current task name.
- A "Check for updates" entry in the sidebar nav.

### Changed

- Archiving via the icon no longer runs a skill by default; the skill flow
  moves into the right-click menu with an editable command.
- The task overview drops its archived collapse groups (sessions + subtasks).

### Fixed

- Worktree provisioning no longer hangs on a git fetch credential prompt;
  stale-dir removal retries on ENOTEMPTY/EBUSY races.
- Provision-error tasks gain a retry action from both the dead-end view and the
  tab context menu.
- Quick project creation no longer flickers from top to middle in the sidebar.

## 0.11.1 — 2026-06-13

### Changed

- Run-mode selection switches to a card layout with explicit confirmation.
- Compare mode groups its child tasks under a session-less parent task.

## 0.11.0 — 2026-06-13

### Added

- **Automation engine (P1)**: an in-process scheduler (croner) rebuilt from the
  DB on boot, with manual / cron triggers, timezone and next-run-time editing, a
  last-run status dot, and an `automation_runs` history table. Runs execute from
  the main process via `createTask` (landing in internal Drafts, auto-approved),
  back-filled by agent session events; overlapping runs are skipped and
  interrupted runs are swept on startup. (Running against a real project branch
  is deferred to P1b.)
- **Split view**: the main content area can show multiple tasks side by side.
- **Global side pane full-window expand**: the global sidebar can expand to fill
  the whole window.
- **Run-mode picker reworked**: a Dialog-based picker with fixed-width agent
  labels and single-line compact agent cards; "compare" is split into its own
  group and renamed to "探索" (Explore).

### Changed

- Sidebar reorganized: Automation and Skills move into the task area (alongside
  each other); Settings moves after Mobile. The Runtime settings page is merged
  into a single accordion, and the legacy review-prompt setting is removed.

### Fixed

- Team mode workers run as sessions of the same task rather than separate tasks;
  compare-mode candidates are isolated in their own worktrees with parent/child
  grouping.
- Agents account tab: responsive tables and tab strips (icon-only on narrow
  panels, threshold raised to 820px), accordion details grow with content, and
  long emails truncate instead of wrapping.

## 0.10.4 — 2026-06-13

### Added

- Warp Preview detection plus a CLI PATH fallback scan for runtime discovery.
- View menu gains a "Toggle Left Sidebar" checkbox.

### Fixed

- macOS: closing the last window now hides the app so reopening from the dock
  doesn't replay the boot screen; clicking the dock reopens the main window.
- Titlebar nav no longer occasionally disappears from `isLeftOpen` mirror-state
  drift; collapsing the sidebar falls back to the default titlebar with nav
  buttons intact.
- Font picker: hover feedback restored (uses `background-1`), and the popover
  widens to 260px so the placeholder isn't truncated.
- Home: the inert "+" button is hidden when the app tab strip is hidden.
- Boot screen: the bottom-right code block aligns with the left boot log.
- **Login-shell env capture wrapped in sentinels** (`__YODA_ENV_START__` /
  `__YODA_ENV_END__`, mirroring VS Code's shell-env): interactive-shell banner
  noise (powerlevel10k instant prompt, oh-my-zsh, version-manager banners) no
  longer pollutes the parsed `PATH`, fixing GUI launches where `claude` / `tmux`
  and other CLIs went undetected despite being on the user's PATH.

## 0.10.3 — 2026-06-13

### Added

- **Sticky tabs**: a tab dragged back from another scope stays in the current
  tab strip alongside its origin — drop position decides activation, cross-scope
  drops surface a "go to" toast, and `stripScope` is decoupled so a sticky tab
  renders content without rewriting the strip.
- **Tab drag completion**: the main content area accepts drag-backs on every
  route's central column, bottom terminal tabs support drag reordering, and
  global-sidebar copy pins (view/overview) can return to the main window.
- **Boot flow rework**: the main window shows immediately with a static splash
  (centered Hood mark) covering the renderer loading phase, then waits for
  user confirmation to enter.
- The scripts list gains a "new script" row linking to project settings;
  `releases.lovstudio.ai` update feed resurrected via a Vercel redirect.

### Changed

- Packaged builds ship only native deps and bundle the rest into `out/`,
  slimming the install footprint.
- Composer settings popover visual hierarchy rebuilt with tightened spacing
  and width-adaptive toolbars.

### Fixed

- **Updater race**: releases are now created as drafts and published only
  after all platform assets upload — mac update checks no longer 404 during
  the upload window.
- Tab dragging is pointer-driven, fixing real drags not registering; drops no
  longer switch routes unexpectedly.
- About panel shows the app version instead of the Electron version in dev.

## 0.10.2 — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Composer principles**: the composer settings popover can toggle individual
  atomic prompt principles, with instruction-file viewing and management;
  comments move to icon hover.
- **Cross-area tab moves**: tab drag-and-drop and right-click move now work
  across all three tab areas.
- **Bottom panel modes as tabs**: mode switching is flat tabs aligned with the
  sidebar chip design; each mode tab can detach independently, and empty
  states show feature cards matching sidebar interactions.
- Mobile gateway hardened across desktop restarts and network changes; Expo
  Metro restarts when the LAN host changes.

### Fixed

- App startup no longer blocks ~4s on login-shell environment capture —
  `resolveUserEnv` runs as async exec.
- Update manifests pin versioned URLs, enabling differential downloads.
- Composer popover ContextItem no longer crashes outside a task view.
- Boot screen blink cursor falls back to a muted hollow outline.

## 0.10.1 — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **AI Lab as an App center**: the lab view is rebuilt around a launcher grid
  backed by an App registry, ready to host more built-in apps beyond logo
  generation.
- **Navigation slimmed down**: the sidebar nav keeps four entries — website /
  docs / settings / feedback; Kanban, AI Lab, and Roadmap move into settings
  tabs, and the website gains a Roadmap page.
- Browser history entries can be deleted from the list.

### Changed

- **Brand v17 rollout continues**: the landing page cover (hero background +
  og:image) is rebuilt around The Hood identity, and the README aligns with
  the v17 brand layer (mark in the heading, official backronym, design-language
  link).

### Fixed

- The nav section popped out from the sidebar version anchor now collapses
  when clicking outside.
- Lint no longer scans `.worktrees/**` artifacts from the parent checkout.

## 0.10.0 — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **New brand identity — “The Hood”**: a vectorized mark (rounded-triangle
  robe, teardrop cowl negative space, one luminous presence inside) drawn from
  the ygreen theme. Rolled out everywhere: macOS/Windows/Linux app icons (with
  distinct beta/canary dot colors), in-app lockups (mark + YODA wordmark with
  outlined type), the boot screen now opens with the breathing mark, the
  landing page is rethemed to the identity, and a new `/design/` page on
  yoda.lovstudio.ai documents the full identity system (mark anatomy, lockup
  sizing rules, icon variants, palette).
- **AI Lab**: logo/image generation view with dual engines (ZenMux Vertex
  protocol and Codex CLI).
- **AI invocation logs**: a settings tab recording every AI call from start to
  finish — including per-turn prompts of interactive sessions — shown as a
  table; rows are written at call start (`running`) so hangs are visible.
- **Markdown Front Matter rendering**: key-value table at the top of rendered
  Markdown, nested objects flattened to dot-path rows, tolerant of BOM and
  leading blank lines.

### Changed

- Worktree paths flattened and hash-mode branch names shortened.
- Task menu assembly extracted into `useTaskMenuActions`; the top overview tab
  reuses the same task menu.
- Settings navigation column: breakpoint tuning, fit-content width, and
  scroll-constraint fixes for the bottom tabs.

### Fixed

- Session panel sections no longer disappear when main-area file tabs close,
  and the file menu no longer deadlocks after switching panels.
- Interactive session logs record the actual agent command instead of the
  tmux wrapper command.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Cross-project Agent kanban (Alpha)**: a board view spanning projects —
  drag tasks between status columns, per-column configurable hooks, and card
  hover peek showing the summary, diff stats, and session state.
- **Skills, round two**: trigger testing (one-click verify that a skill would
  actually fire), generalized AI iteration (free-form edits, fork copies,
  linked trigger tests), a tree layout grouping skills by name prefix
  (brand/author) with count and length sorting, real invocation stats with
  multi-dimensional sorting (alphabetical by default), and skills treated as
  files via the shared file-action components; detail header reworked with
  actions consolidated into a single overflow menu.
- **Custom run principles**: a new Prompts settings page whose content is
  injected as a system prompt at session start, with a persona section
  rendered in the context panel.
- **Status aggregation**: sidebar task rows roll up session states by display
  priority — awaiting input > awaiting review > running > marked unread >
  idle; session tab icons reflect run state, and the task-level icon keeps
  only a notification signal that jumps to the pending session on click.
- **Branch controls split**: branch selection and fork-or-not are independent
  controls; non-fork runs can check out an existing branch.
- File menu settled into three groups (in-app locations / IDE incl. Finder /
  copy path); the "(current)" marker is detected at runtime; global files can
  open in the sidebar of the current task.

### Fixed

- Third-party IME Chinese punctuation fix is enabled by default, with
  composition guards.
- Dropping a file onto the prompt input attaches it instead of opening a new
  window.
- Stale worktree directory removal failures are surfaced instead of
  swallowed.
- RelativeTime "ago" mode no longer renders a literal `{{time}}` or
  duplicated suffixes; attachment chip labels are no longer clipped.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Theme lineup**: the Matrix palette is promoted to a first-class `ydark`
  theme, joined by 尤达绿 II / 尤达白 II variants; follow-system mode lets you
  pick which light/dark pair to alternate between.
- **Kernel-boot startup screen**: a boot-log style splash that exits on the
  app's ready signal.
- **Browser as a persistent card**: the in-app browser is now a standing
  feature card (Codex-style single page + history) instead of ad-hoc tabs.
- **Skills overhaul**: skill detail opens as a top-level tab instead of a
  modal; invocation stats gain daily history with a 30-day trend chart;
  skills support pinning; the detail page is responsive in narrow containers
  (actions collapse into an icon row / overflow menu).
- **Settings reorganization**: a new "Session" tab groups naming, summary,
  and pre-archive skill options (tmux moved there too); branch auto-naming is
  configurable (time-hash default / AI semantic); worktree location is a
  two-way choice (in-project `.worktrees` / unified directory) with a global
  default; settings pages and embedded views adapt via container queries,
  with a chip-row tab switcher in the sidebar.
- **Side-pane everywhere**: all top-level tabs can open in the sidebar with
  the shell-level cross-route side pane restored; nav items and shortcut
  icons support right-click / Opt+click to open in the global side pane,
  which gains a close button.
- **File actions**: the shared file menu supports opening in the sidebar or
  global sidebar, covers out-of-workspace and global files uniformly, and
  agent-home read-only access extends to `~/.claude` and `~/.codex`.
- Tab polish: the tab icon slot morphs into a close button on hover (no
  trailing close slot); the "+" button stays pinned at the right edge on
  overflow; the app menu is regrouped (About + Updates first, Restart next
  to Quit).

### Changed

- **Naming direction flipped**: the session name is now the source of truth —
  task names follow it, and branch names are decoupled from titles.

### Fixed

- Explicitly stored `null` settings are no longer treated as missing and
  reset to defaults.
- Force turn-started when an answered interactive tool resolves
  awaiting-input, fixing stuck run states.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **In-app browser pane**: URLs clicked in the terminal (smart links, OSC 8
  hyperlinks, link gestures) open in a sidebar webview tab with back / forward
  / refresh, an address bar, and an open-in-system-browser action. Re-clicking
  the same URL activates its existing tab; tab position and title persist with
  view snapshots. `_blank` popups navigate in place and non-http(s) URLs are
  denied.

### Changed

- **Sidebar version anchor**: the bottom account row is replaced by a
  logo + product name + version anchor that toggles the nav section; when an
  update is available the version turns accent-colored with a download
  shortcut to Settings → General.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Branch finish flow**: a status-aware titlebar CTA with review / merge /
  archive panels — local squash merge via RPC, AI-generated commit messages,
  and a conflict-resolution agent.
- **Branch display modes**: sidebar task rows support three branch-display
  tiers (hidden / compact / full); compact mode shows the branch suffix in a
  fixed leading gutter, with two-line layout in full mode.
- **Prompt history blinds**: the status bar expands prompt history in-place
  with a push-up "blinds" layout — click to jump to the matching terminal
  position, configurable head/tail line counts, persisted expansion.
- **Archived review**: archived sessions and subtasks expand in place for
  inspection, with a read-only transcript viewer; session archiving gains
  sub-options (direct / with skill / configure).
- **Project-level token stats** with multi-dimensional visualizations; the
  token usage card now auto-refreshes incrementally as turns complete.
- **Workspace ownership**: projects belong to a single workspace — conflicts
  surface an explicit three-way dialog, and moving a project follows it with
  the view.
- **Roadmap reports**: all learn-agent-design research reports are published
  and linked from the roadmap view.
- Device-flow login dialog redesigned with prefetched codes for instant
  display; mobile connect page reworked into a two-step guide; task index
  tabs show "project / branch".

### Changed

- **Bottom panel rebuilt as tabs**: the drawer is now a multi-content tab bar
  (terminal / session), scripts split into a standalone mode, the drawer
  sidebar removed, and a horizontal expand toggle controls how the bottom bar
  relates to the sidebar. Visibility and mode are global preferences persisted
  across tasks and sessions.
- Terminal settings promoted to a top-level tab with auto-copy on by default;
  prompt history migrated into the session tab.
- Status bar truncation counts centered, toggle entry moved to a config icon,
  hover expand/collapse arrows added.

### Fixed

- OSC 52 handled in the PTY so tmux copy-mode selections reach the clipboard.
- Project tabs persist with an explicit view, fixing intermittent dead clicks
  when opening project details; pinned tabs are synthesized from visibleTabs.
- Slug separators normalized to hyphens; tab titles strip the branch prefix.
- "Configure in project settings" jumps directly to the project settings page;
  compact-tier indentation unified across sidebar task lists.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-06-11

Version note: 0.5.0 skips the 0.3.12–0.4.x range, which is occupied by
preserved pre-Yoda release tags.

### Added

- **Scoped app tabs**: a top-level tab system with per-scope tab strips — tabs
  can be pinned to the task sidebar strip, duplicated into full windows (Window
  → Duplicate), and the task title bar is slimmed down to three controls.
- **Usage stats**: a new stats domain parses Claude/Codex transcripts into
  token usage — usage overview view with a token heatmap, per-session usage
  chips, a project token-usage card, and task diff snapshots.
- **Nested subtasks**: tasks support arbitrary-depth parent/child hierarchies
  with collapsible sidebar trees and a new-subtask modal.
- **Session panel overhaul**: section visibility/order management, summary
  snapshots, a Statusline section with template switching, hooks section
  counts, and per-session token usage grouping.
- **Composer attachments**: native image paste and file chips as inline atomic
  tokens, injected in text order with configurable transfer modes.
- **Roadmap view**: an embedded research roadmap with report states.
- Built-in **Yoda Warm** theme; PDF inline preview in the editor; built-in
  Agent entities for internal LLM utilities; subscription account service with
  official-API probe and model pricing table; Fumadocs docs site.

### Changed

- **Terminology: provider → runtime** across settings, selectors, registry,
  and i18n — a Runtime is the CLI execution environment, an Agent is the
  prompt+skills entity.
- Sidebar navigation consolidated into a settings hub; account row hosts quick
  icons; workspace switcher menus flattened with attention-count badges.
- Task area reworked to a bottom-bar-first layout with a full-width terminal
  drawer in tabbed layout; two-axis task sorting with a view-options panel.
- Archive orchestration moved into the main process — archives survive
  renderer reloads, with task/conversation archive two-way linking.
- Terminal resize pipeline rebuilt: freeze layer + rAF-throttled commits
  eliminate white flashes, jitter, and rubber-banding; sidebar exit is
  pixel-isolated via flexbox.
- Session titles prefer user > yoda > agent naming; home greeting rewritten.

### Fixed

- Smart path links survive Claude Code's hard-wrapped lines (cross-line
  reassembly for paths and URLs); path detection stops at ASCII brackets.
- Interrupt markers suppress zombie "working" states from stateless
  re-derivation; questionnaire awaiting states sync correctly.
- Multiline prompt injection no longer renders literal `\n`; per-session
  resize IPC dedup fixes narrow CLI rendering after unpin.
- Cmd+Z works in the composer again; unified IME composition guards across
  inputs; tooltip triggers no longer collapse icon-button heights.
- Renaming an unprovisioned task no longer fails silently; Metro lazy-starts
  and cleans up orphaned processes on mobile.

## 0.3.11 — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Customizable sidebar**: reorder and hide the secondary navigation items via
  a drag-and-drop "Customize sidebar" settings card, backed by a single source
  of truth for nav items.
- **Live agent runtime indicators**: a new agent runtime store surfaces
  running/attention badges per task across the sidebar and workspace switcher,
  with workspace-level task counts.
- **Conversation runtime aggregation**: aggregate per-conversation running/idle
  state across projects and tasks.
- Expand the mobile gateway and mobile app to consume runtime status with a
  richer in-app UI.

### Changed

- Consolidate prompt-injection logic into a shared payload builder (Claude stays
  raw; other providers wrap multiline payloads in bracketed paste).
- Refine Claude/Codex run-state sources and keep the specific awaiting-input
  sub-state on non-forced turn starts, so permission/elicitation prompts are no
  longer clobbered by a bare "working" spinner.
- Rename the repository settings card to a GitHub settings card.

## 0.3.10 — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Workspaces**: group and switch projects into named workspaces from the
  sidebar, with a workspace switcher and a new bottom account/user entry.
- **Configurable agents**: define and manage custom agent entities (create,
  edit, manage) and surface provider + model summaries on the home run controls.
- **Agent hooks inspector**: inspect agent hook executions with exec
  enrichment/shim and per-hook overrides (apply + persisted store).
- Add a redesigned task view split into overview, session, harness, and hooks
  panels, plus background auto-rename and pre-archive skill execution.
- Add Claude/Codex run-state sources and transcript parsing, on-demand session
  summary generation, conversation runtime status, and a conversation restart
  flow.

### Changed

- **Rework agent run-state synchronization** so the running/idle indicator is
  accurate — fixing stuck spinners and conversations that looked busy when idle.
- Refresh the sidebar (workspace grouping, unified nav icons, account entry) and
  command-palette scoped search with fuzzy skill autocomplete.
- Let the project selector show full paths and correctly attribute
  subdirectories; improve session prompt previews.
- Improve PTY terminal sizing and rendering (right-edge overflow, tmux scroll
  residue, restart half-screen).

### Fixed

- Fix agent running-state desync that caused stuck spinners and wrong idle state.
- Stop the sidebar from spinning indefinitely when a pre-archive skill runs.
- Fix terminal right-side overflow, trailing whitespace, and tmux scroll
  artifacts; fix restart-task menu and half-screen terminal.
- Fix macOS "Open in Finder" to enter the folder instead of highlighting the
  parent directory.

## 0.3.9 — 2026-06-07

### Added

- Add the Expo mobile app workspace and a token-protected desktop mobile gateway
  for viewing project/task state and creating new requests from mobile.
- Add project sessions views and issue/task linking improvements across project
  overview and issue surfaces.
- Add model candidate discovery, agent model settings, and skill usage/validation
  details in the desktop UI.
- Add task/session naming helpers, rename flows, archive support, and richer
  conversation runtime state.

### Changed

- Refresh home, task, sidebar, skills, settings, theme, and context-panel UI
  flows for denser task navigation and clearer session state.
- Expand agent-facing docs for mobile development and update workspace/package
  scripts for mobile commands.
- Improve PTY link handling, terminal sizing, custom themes, and provider/model
  configuration plumbing.

### Fixed

- Harden task archiving, quit-session prompts, Codex session restoration, and
  session-title generation.
- Fix issue list synchronization, sidebar persistence, task title display, and
  renderer error isolation.
- Improve i18n coverage and terminology consistency.

## 0.3.8 — 2026-06-04

### Added

- Add Codex session recovery support that can restore rollout terminal history
  and reuse the original Codex session id when reopening or unarchiving
  historical conversations.
- Add richer task/session context actions, including copyable basic session
  info, resolved resume commands, project paths, working directories, and
  provider details from task menus.
- Add task tab-strip coverage for task sessions so terminal and conversation
  navigation state is easier to preserve across task views.

### Changed

- Default tmux task settings to enabled for new project settings so long-running
  agent sessions are protected by default.
- Clarify Yoda's independent project branding and remove the legacy automatic
  Emdash data-directory migration path.

### Fixed

- Improve PTY drag selection auto-copy reliability, including terminals running
  in mouse mode.
- Harden Codex session title extraction and session info resolution across
  mounted projects and archived task states.

## 0.3.7 — 2026-06-02

### Added

- Add Codex context-panel support with runtime metadata, system/developer
  messages, memory files, dynamic tools, turn context, and session prompts.
- Add live Codex/Claude skill and agent scanning so context details refresh from
  user, project, and plugin directories instead of relying only on startup
  transcript snapshots.
- Add tmux session persistence on app quit, including keep-running decisions,
  fallback notifications when tmux is unavailable, and install actions from
  task settings.
- Add task context-menu copy actions for session id, project path, and provider
  resume command.
- Add Typeless voice-input integration on the home prompt.

### Changed

- Move projectless workflows into the regular task pipeline through the internal
  Drafts project, including automatic return to Home after Drafts sessions exit.
- Refresh context-panel layout with scrollable long sections, grouped MCP tools,
  cleaner skill parsing, and denser context rows.
- Let task titles start rename on click and show concrete IDE names in Open In
  controls.
- Upgrade Electron to 41.7.1 and align native dependency rebuilding for the new
  runtime.

### Fixed

- Harden startup and repository handling for non-git directories and broken
  skill symlinks.
- Fix sidebar HMR row positioning by separating virtualizer layout from drag
  transforms.
- Fix Vitest better-sqlite3 ABI mismatches by using a Node-ABI test shim while
  preserving Electron ABI rebuilds for app runtime.
- Suppress noisy IME diagnostic logging.

## 0.3.6 — 2026-06-02

### Added

- Add `yoda://` and `yoda-canary://` deep links for opening a specific task
  session from another app, including anchors for a prompt id or prompt index
  in the Claude context panel.
- Register the production and canary app protocol handlers in packaged builds
  and route cold-start or already-running deep links into the renderer.

### Changed

- Refresh the home run controls with inline run-mode tabs, explicit local/SSH
  host display, and review-mode branch strategy selection.

## 0.3.5 — 2026-05-31

### Added

- Add richer projectless workflows from the home view, including compare,
  review, team, path mention autocomplete, skill shortcuts, and resumable
  projectless sidebar sessions.
- Add the MaaS dashboard and ZenMux usage integration, with encrypted API key
  storage and invocation history views.
- Add task review markers, archive-without-command handling, Claude context
  inspection, and Codex title generation support.
- Add sidebar grouping modes, pinned projects, projectless session rows, and
  expanded tests around the new task, conversation, terminal, and logger flows.

### Changed

- Remove the task titlebar conversation switcher and shift conversation
  navigation into the updated task surface.
- Improve the development Electron bundle preparation so the local macOS app
  keeps Yoda metadata without repeatedly patching the installed Electron app.
- Surface copyable debug information on toasts and route more failures through
  structured logger metadata.

### Fixed

- Stabilize PTY first-layout measurement, restored views, bottom spacing, and
  dark Codex input readability.
- Improve terminal file links and optional IME diagnostics/native punctuation
  handling.
- Tighten projectless default directory creation, conversation resume behavior,
  and path completion safety checks.

## 0.3.4 — 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- Route stable auto-update checks through GitHub Releases and publish the
  generated update manifests and blockmaps with production release artifacts.
- Merge macOS x64 and arm64 update manifests so both architectures can discover
  the latest release from the same feed.

## 0.3.3 — 2026-05-25

### Added

- Add projectless home sessions that can run without creating a project task or
  worktree.
- Add the docs app entrypoint and build configuration.

### Changed

- Rename the no-project selector option to "Do not use a project" /
  "不使用项目" and explain the behavior on hover.
- Improve update check state handling and user-facing update messages.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-05-25

### Added

- Add renderer i18n coverage for the main workspace, settings, projects, tasks,
  integrations, MCP, skills, and shared UI surfaces.

### Fixed

- Fix Chinese language resolution so Settings → Language updates the interface
  immediately instead of falling back to English.
- Translate remaining top-level Chinese labels and render localized select
  values in settings controls.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- Suppress Octokit request logging so GitHub API failures cannot write noisy
  stderr output through the default logger.
- Allow task creation to continue when no project is selected, including an
  explicit no-project option in the selector.
- Publish GitHub Release notes from `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed

- Refresh public download links and agentic CLI reference docs.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Lovcode integration**: new `lovcode` main-process controller and
  service (`checkAvailability`, `search`). Command palette gains a
  Lovcode-backed search source, an install banner when Lovcode isn't
  detected, and shared types in `src/shared/lovcode.ts`.
- **Agents view**: dedicated renderer feature under
  `src/renderer/features/agents/` with its own view registry entry and
  `agents_viewed` telemetry event.
- **Command palette qualifiers**: structured query qualifiers
  (`qualifiers.ts`) and a Lovcode search hook
  (`use-lovcode-search.ts`).
- **Custom command on archive**: tasks can run a project-defined command
  before archiving (`src/renderer/features/projects/run-project-command.ts`).
- **Mark task for review**: new task state plus surfacing in the sidebar
  and task titlebar.
- **Project aliases**: projects can carry a custom alias used in UI and
  search.
- **Claude session metadata**: new
  `src/main/core/conversations/getClaudeSessionMetadata.ts` helper for
  resolving Claude session identity.
- **Project overview view**: new `overview-view/` panel for projects.
- **Task panel**: extracted `task-panel.tsx` to host the task surface.

### Changed

- Command palette modal refactored to support multiple search sources
  (Lovcode, qualifiers, built-ins) with shared scoring/filtering.
- Conversations controller and panel updated to consume Claude session
  metadata and surface it in the create-conversation modal.
- Settings schema and project-settings shared types extended for
  archive-command and alias fields. Settings registry wired accordingly.
- Sidebar and task titlebar reflect the new mark-for-review and
  alias-aware project naming. Agent status indicator polished.
- i18n: large new key set in `en.json` and `zh-CN.json` for Lovcode,
  agents, qualifiers, archive note, and review states.
- Telemetry `FocusView` adds `'agents'`.
- Navigation store and keyboard shortcuts wired for the new agents view.

### Fixed

- PTY: pure CJK / non-ASCII messages now correctly trigger the sidebar
  "working" state.
- Tasks: in-flight lock added when archiving so a task cannot be
  double-archived.
- Tooltip: nested-`button` hydration warning from `TooltipTrigger` fixed.

### CI

- Dropped the `nix-build` workflow.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-05-12

### Added

- Home draft persistence (prompt, project, strategy, provider) via a new
  `homeDraft` app setting. Includes an opt-in "express mode" so the
  sidebar `+` button can create a task instantly using the last
  configured runtime.
- Time-of-day greeting on the home view, using the account profile name.
- Optional **archive note** when archiving a task — surfaced inline on
  task rows and gated behind a new `Archive task with note…` menu entry.
  Drizzle migration `0013_rare_dagger` adds the `archive_note` column.
- "Archived only with notes" filter in the project task view.
- `name` field on the account profile (alongside `username`), updated
  from device-flow and refresh-token responses, displayed on the
  Settings → Account tab.

### Changed

- Sidebar: collapsible "Pinned" and "Projects" groups (persisted),
  project filter (all / local / SSH), sort menu, expand/collapse all,
  reset task order. Project / task / pinned-task rows share the refreshed
  visual language.
- Strategy chip on the home view now reads "Worktree" / "In-place" with
  descriptive popovers explaining the trade-offs.
- `useEffectiveProvider` accepts an external override so the home view
  can bind provider selection to the persisted draft.
- Resize handles in the task layout suppress panel-transition
  animations while dragging, and guard against redundant
  collapse/expand churn. Task titlebar shows the current branch next to
  the project chip. Agent-selector popover sizes to content.

### Fixed

- Feedback submission no longer relies on a Discord webhook. The
  renderer hook calls a new `feedback` RPC controller that posts to the
  Yoda backend with multipart form data (message, category,
  attachments, app version), authenticated via the session token.
- Boot ordering in `src/main/index.ts`: `resolveUserEnv()` now runs in
  the background so a heavy zsh login shell can no longer add 1–2s to
  app launch; app settings and the RPC router are initialized before
  the main window is created so the renderer's first paint never races
  IPC.
- New-terminal hotkey in `TerminalsPanel` uses
  `conflictBehavior: 'replace'`.
- PR controller and PR sync scheduler replace dynamic imports with
  static ones (per project convention).

### Dev / DX

- `.npmrc` pins `use-node-version=24.14.0` for consistent pnpm runs.
- `pnpm run d` uses `--prefer-frozen-lockfile --reporter=append-only
--silent` to quiet routine installs.
- `scripts/dev.ts` filters known-noisy Electron/macOS log lines unless
  `YODA_DEV_VERBOSE=1` is set.
- `scripts/postinstall.ts` renames the dev Electron.app bundle to
  "Yoda" on macOS so the dock label matches prod.
- `electron-vite` main/preload builds use `emptyOutDir: true` and
  suppress non-actionable `DYNAMIC_IMPORT_WILL_NOT_MOVE_MODULE`
  warnings.
- Kimi CLI doc URL updated to its new `moonshotai.github.io` location.

## 0.1.3 — 2026-05-11

### Added

- Project archive / unarchive operations with corresponding sidebar UI
  affordances and right-click menu entries.
- Session-title module (`src/main/core/session-title/`) that derives
  human-readable conversation titles from Claude transcripts.
- i18n string coverage for the new sidebar and create-task flows
  (English + Simplified Chinese).
- Drizzle migrations `0011_deep_wolf_cub` and `0012_tired_cammi` for the
  archive flag and session-title fields.

### Changed

- Sidebar redesign: project items, project menu, task items, and the
  left sidebar shell now share a consistent visual language with the
  refreshed home view.
- Create-task modal: branch picker, from-branch / from-issue / from-PR
  flows, and the initial-conversation section are unified around the
  new layout.
- `getProjects` and the project manager surface archived state to the
  renderer; `renameTask` and task utilities adapt to the shared task
  naming module.

### Removed

- Legacy `modal-context-bar`, `editor/file-tabs`, and
  `view/unified-main-tab-bar` components superseded by the redesign.

## 0.1.2 — 2026-05-11

### Added

- First release with full Apple Developer ID signing and notarization
  using the `lovstudio` org-level secrets (`APPLE_CERTIFICATE`,
  `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD`,
  `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`) shared with `lovcode`.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- Make Apple/Azure code signing and R2 upload conditional in
  `release-prod.yml` so the workflow can produce unsigned artifacts when
  optional secrets are absent. Adds GitHub Release upload as a fallback
  artifact destination.
- Switch macOS signing secrets to the `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` /
  `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` / `APPLE_PASSWORD` naming used elsewhere
  in the lovstudio org.
- `notarize-mac.ts` now accepts either an App Store Connect API key
  (`APPLE_API_KEY*`) or an Apple ID + app-specific password
  (`APPLE_ID` + `APPLE_PASSWORD` + `APPLE_TEAM_ID`).
- `electron-builder.config.ts` reads `YODA_DISABLE_WIN_SIGNING` and
  `YODA_DISABLE_MAC_SIGNING` to opt out of code signing per-build.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-11

First Yoda release. This version establishes the independent product identity
and includes a number of UX and infrastructure changes.

### Added

- Finalize Yoda naming across the app, packaging, sign-in flow, and branding
  assets.
- Sign-in via Lovstudio device flow.
- i18n: bootstrap `i18next` + `react-i18next` with English and Simplified
  Chinese locales; translate the settings, onboarding, MCP, and skills views;
  add a Language card to settings.
- Pinyin-aware task slug generation via `pinyin-pro`.
- New home view with project + agent selectors and quick actions.
- Sidebar restructure (project items, task items, project menu).
- Richer task context menu and a new "Manage run scripts" modal.
- Refreshed task titlebar and unified main tab bar.

### Changed

- Centralize task name slug logic in `src/shared/task-name.ts` (shared between
  main and renderer).
- Drop the renderer-only `utils/taskNames` helper.

### Removed

- Unused `comments-popover` and `context-bar` components from the
  conversations panel.
