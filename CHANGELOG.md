# Changelog

All notable changes to Yoda will be documented in this file.

This project resets to **0.1.0** with the rebrand from `emdash` to `yoda`. Older
release history (`v0.4.x`, `v1.1.x`) belongs to the upstream `emdash` codebase
and is preserved in git tags only.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- Suppress Octokit request logging so GitHub API failures cannot write noisy
  stderr output through the default logger.
- Allow task creation to continue when no project is selected, including an
  explicit no-project option in the selector.
- Publish GitHub Release notes from `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed

- Refresh public download links and agentic CLI reference docs.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Lovcode integration**: new `lovcode` main-process controller and
  service (`checkAvailability`, `search`). Command palette gains a
  Lovcode-backed search source, an install banner when Lovcode isn't
  detected, and shared types in `src/shared/lovcode.ts`.
- **Agents view**: dedicated renderer feature under
  `src/renderer/features/agents/` with its own view registry entry and
  `agents_viewed` telemetry event.
- **Command palette qualifiers**: structured query qualifiers
  (`qualifiers.ts`) and a Lovcode search hook
  (`use-lovcode-search.ts`).
- **Custom command on archive**: tasks can run a project-defined command
  before archiving (`src/renderer/features/projects/run-project-command.ts`).
- **Mark task for review**: new task state plus surfacing in the sidebar
  and task titlebar.
- **Project aliases**: projects can carry a custom alias used in UI and
  search.
- **Claude session metadata**: new
  `src/main/core/conversations/getClaudeSessionMetadata.ts` helper for
  resolving Claude session identity.
- **Project overview view**: new `overview-view/` panel for projects.
- **Task panel**: extracted `task-panel.tsx` to host the task surface.

### Changed

- Command palette modal refactored to support multiple search sources
  (Lovcode, qualifiers, built-ins) with shared scoring/filtering.
- Conversations controller and panel updated to consume Claude session
  metadata and surface it in the create-conversation modal.
- Settings schema and project-settings shared types extended for
  archive-command and alias fields. Settings registry wired accordingly.
- Sidebar and task titlebar reflect the new mark-for-review and
  alias-aware project naming. Agent status indicator polished.
- i18n: large new key set in `en.json` and `zh-CN.json` for Lovcode,
  agents, qualifiers, archive note, and review states.
- Telemetry `FocusView` adds `'agents'`.
- Navigation store and keyboard shortcuts wired for the new agents view.

### Fixed

- PTY: pure CJK / non-ASCII messages now correctly trigger the sidebar
  "working" state.
- Tasks: in-flight lock added when archiving so a task cannot be
  double-archived.
- Tooltip: nested-`button` hydration warning from `TooltipTrigger` fixed.

### CI

- Dropped the `nix-build` workflow.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-05-12

### Added

- Home draft persistence (prompt, project, strategy, provider) via a new
  `homeDraft` app setting. Includes an opt-in "express mode" so the
  sidebar `+` button can create a task instantly using the last
  configured runtime.
- Time-of-day greeting on the home view, using the account profile name.
- Optional **archive note** when archiving a task — surfaced inline on
  task rows and gated behind a new `Archive task with note…` menu entry.
  Drizzle migration `0013_rare_dagger` adds the `archive_note` column.
- "Archived only with notes" filter in the project task view.
- `name` field on the account profile (alongside `username`), updated
  from device-flow and refresh-token responses, displayed on the
  Settings → Account tab.

### Changed

- Sidebar: collapsible "Pinned" and "Projects" groups (persisted),
  project filter (all / local / SSH), sort menu, expand/collapse all,
  reset task order. Project / task / pinned-task rows share the refreshed
  visual language.
- Strategy chip on the home view now reads "Worktree" / "In-place" with
  descriptive popovers explaining the trade-offs.
- `useEffectiveProvider` accepts an external override so the home view
  can bind provider selection to the persisted draft.
- Resize handles in the task layout suppress panel-transition
  animations while dragging, and guard against redundant
  collapse/expand churn. Task titlebar shows the current branch next to
  the project chip. Agent-selector popover sizes to content.

### Fixed

- Feedback submission no longer relies on a Discord webhook. The
  renderer hook calls a new `feedback` RPC controller that posts to the
  Yoda backend with multipart form data (message, category,
  attachments, app version), authenticated via the session token.
- Boot ordering in `src/main/index.ts`: `resolveUserEnv()` now runs in
  the background so a heavy zsh login shell can no longer add 1–2s to
  app launch; app settings and the RPC router are initialized before
  the main window is created so the renderer's first paint never races
  IPC.
- New-terminal hotkey in `TerminalsPanel` uses
  `conflictBehavior: 'replace'`.
- PR controller and PR sync scheduler replace dynamic imports with
  static ones (per project convention).

### Dev / DX

- `.npmrc` pins `use-node-version=24.14.0` for consistent pnpm runs.
- `pnpm run d` uses `--prefer-frozen-lockfile --reporter=append-only
  --silent` to quiet routine installs.
- `scripts/dev.ts` filters known-noisy Electron/macOS log lines unless
  `YODA_DEV_VERBOSE=1` is set.
- `scripts/postinstall.ts` renames the dev Electron.app bundle to
  "Yoda" on macOS so the dock label matches prod.
- `electron-vite` main/preload builds use `emptyOutDir: true` and
  suppress non-actionable `DYNAMIC_IMPORT_WILL_NOT_MOVE_MODULE`
  warnings.
- Kimi CLI doc URL updated to its new `moonshotai.github.io` location.

## 0.1.3 — 2026-05-11

### Added

- Project archive / unarchive operations with corresponding sidebar UI
  affordances and right-click menu entries.
- Session-title module (`src/main/core/session-title/`) that derives
  human-readable conversation titles from Claude transcripts.
- i18n string coverage for the new sidebar and create-task flows
  (English + Simplified Chinese).
- Drizzle migrations `0011_deep_wolf_cub` and `0012_tired_cammi` for the
  archive flag and session-title fields.

### Changed

- Sidebar redesign: project items, project menu, task items, and the
  left sidebar shell now share a consistent visual language with the
  refreshed home view.
- Create-task modal: branch picker, from-branch / from-issue / from-PR
  flows, and the initial-conversation section are unified around the
  new layout.
- `getProjects` and the project manager surface archived state to the
  renderer; `renameTask` and task utilities adapt to the shared task
  naming module.

### Removed

- Legacy `modal-context-bar`, `editor/file-tabs`, and
  `view/unified-main-tab-bar` components superseded by the redesign.

## 0.1.2 — 2026-05-11

### Added

- First release with full Apple Developer ID signing and notarization
  using the `lovstudio` org-level secrets (`APPLE_CERTIFICATE`,
  `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD`,
  `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`) shared with `lovcode`.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- Make Apple/Azure code signing and R2 upload conditional in
  `release-prod.yml` so the workflow can produce unsigned artifacts when
  optional secrets are absent. Adds GitHub Release upload as a fallback
  artifact destination.
- Switch macOS signing secrets to the `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` /
  `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` / `APPLE_PASSWORD` naming used elsewhere
  in the lovstudio org.
- `notarize-mac.ts` now accepts either an App Store Connect API key
  (`APPLE_API_KEY*`) or an Apple ID + app-specific password
  (`APPLE_ID` + `APPLE_PASSWORD` + `APPLE_TEAM_ID`).
- `electron-builder.config.ts` reads `YODA_DISABLE_WIN_SIGNING` and
  `YODA_DISABLE_MAC_SIGNING` to opt out of code signing per-build.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-11

First release under the `yoda` name. This version represents a full rebrand and
incorporates a number of UX and infrastructure changes on top of the upstream
fork.

### Added

- Rename `emdash` → `yoda` across the app, packaging, sign-in flow, and
  branding assets.
- Sign-in via Lovstudio device flow.
- i18n: bootstrap `i18next` + `react-i18next` with English and Simplified
  Chinese locales; translate the settings, onboarding, MCP, and skills views;
  add a Language card to settings.
- Pinyin-aware task slug generation via `pinyin-pro`.
- New home view with project + agent selectors and quick actions.
- Sidebar restructure (project items, task items, project menu).
- Richer task context menu and a new "Manage run scripts" modal.
- Refreshed task titlebar and unified main tab bar.

### Changed

- Centralize task name slug logic in `src/shared/task-name.ts` (shared between
  main and renderer).
- Drop the renderer-only `utils/taskNames` helper.

### Removed

- Unused `comments-popover` and `context-bar` components from the
  conversations panel.
