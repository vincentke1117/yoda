## Why Yoda

Modern coding agents are powerful — but managing more than one at a time devolves quickly: terminals multiply, branches collide, context evaporates. Yoda was built around a single discipline: **run many agents in parallel without losing the plot.**

Every task spawns an isolated **git worktree** (locally or over SSH), every agent stays sandboxed, every diff is reviewable side‑by‑side, and every merge is deliberate. Dispatch work, review, intervene, and merge with the calm precision of a master orchestrator — instead of the chaos of switching tabs.

Yoda is **provider‑agnostic**: Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini, Amp, Cursor, Copilot, and the rest of your coding-agent CLIs all run under the same orchestration model. It also pipes Linear / GitHub / Jira tickets straight into a session and surfaces CI/CD checks from the sidebar — so the loop from ticket → agent → review → ship lives in one window.

## Highlights

- **Parallel worktrees** — Each task runs in its own `git worktree`, isolated from your working tree. Multiple agents work simultaneously without stomping on each other.
- **Provider‑agnostic** — Bring your coding-agent CLIs with you (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini, Amp, Cursor, Copilot, Cline, Goose, Kimi, Qwen, …). Switch providers per task, not per project.
- **Remote dev over SSH** — Add a remote machine, mount projects on it, and run agents there with the same workflow. Credentials live in your OS keychain.
- **Ticket → session** — Pull Linear / Jira / GitHub Issues / GitLab / Forgejo / Plain tickets straight into a new agent session as the prompt.
- **CI/CD aware** — Watch GitHub Actions / build status next to the diff. Re‑dispatch the agent without leaving the task.
- **Review & archive** — Mark tasks as needs‑review, run pre‑archive commands (e.g. cleanup scripts), then archive with one keystroke.
- **MCP built‑in** — Configure Model Context Protocol servers per project, shared across all agents that support MCP.
- **Local‑first** — App state lives in a local SQLite DB. Yoda itself never phones home with your code; only the agent CLI you chose talks to its provider.
- **Cross‑platform** — Native Electron app for macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel), Windows, and Linux.

## Remote Development over SSH

Connect to remote machines via SSH/SFTP to work with remote codebases without leaving Yoda. Use SSH agent or key authentication; credentials are stored in your OS keychain. Run any supported coding agent on remote projects with the same parallel worktree workflow as local development.

See the [remote development notes](./agents/workflows/remote-development.md) for the current implementation model.

## Architecture

Yoda is an Electron app split into three parts:

- **Main process** (`src/main/`) — Owns the SQLite store (Drizzle), PTY/session orchestration, git worktree management, SSH tunneling, and the provider registry. Exposes a typed RPC surface to the renderer.
- **Renderer** (`src/renderer/`) — React + MobX UI. Reads via React Query, writes via RPC, mounts agent terminals via `node‑pty` round‑trips. View and modal routing are explicit registries.
- **Shared** (`src/shared/`) — Types, IPC contracts, and the agent provider registry that both sides import from.

See [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) and [`agents/`](./agents/) for the full topic map (architecture, workflows, risky areas, conventions).

## Contributing

Small, focused PRs over big bangs. See the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup, conventions, and how to add a new provider. Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/f2fv7YxuR2) to discuss design choices and provider requests.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>What telemetry do you collect and can I disable it?</b></summary>

> We send **anonymous, allow‑listed events** (app start/close, feature usage names, app/platform versions) to PostHog.
> We **do not** send code, file paths, repo names, prompts, or PII.
>
> **Disable telemetry:**
>
> - In the app: **Settings → General → Privacy & Telemetry** (toggle off)
> - Or via env var before launch: `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false`
>
> The tracked event allowlist lives in [`src/shared/telemetry.ts`](./src/shared/telemetry.ts).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Where is my data stored?</b></summary>

> **App data is local‑first.** Yoda stores app state in a local SQLite database:
>
> ```
> macOS:   ~/Library/Application Support/yoda/yoda.db
> Windows: %APPDATA%\yoda\yoda.db
> Linux:   ~/.config/yoda/yoda.db
> ```
>
> **Privacy note:** Yoda itself stores data locally. **When you use a coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Qwen, …), that agent's CLI sends your code and prompts to its own provider's cloud servers** for processing. Each provider has its own data‑handling and retention policy.
>
> You can reset the local DB by deleting the file (quit the app first). It is recreated on next launch.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How does Yoda isolate agents?</b></summary>

> Every task gets its own **git worktree** under a Yoda‑managed directory, separate from your main working tree. Agents only see the files inside their worktree, so simultaneous edits never collide. When you finish a task you can merge, cherry‑pick, or archive — your primary working tree is untouched until you decide.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I add a new provider?</b></summary>

> Yoda is **provider‑agnostic** and built to add CLIs quickly.
>
> - Open a PR following the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
> - Include: provider name, how it's invoked (CLI command), auth notes, and minimal setup steps.
> - The provider lives in `src/shared/agent-provider-registry.ts` plus an output classifier under `src/main/core/conversations/impl/agent-event-classifiers/`.
>
> If you're unsure where to start, open an issue with the CLI's link and typical commands.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What permissions does Yoda need?</b></summary>

> - **Filesystem / Git** — to read/write your repo and create git worktrees for isolation.
> - **Network** — only for the provider CLIs you choose to use and for optional GitHub actions.
> - **Local DB** — to store app state in SQLite on your machine.
>
> Yoda itself does **not** send your code or chats anywhere. Third‑party CLIs may, per their own policies.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I work with remote projects over SSH?</b></summary>

> **Yes.** Yoda supports remote development via SSH.
>
> **Setup:**
> 1. Go to **Settings → SSH Connections** and add your server details.
> 2. Choose authentication: SSH agent (recommended), private key, or password.
> 3. Add a remote project and specify the path on the server.
>
> **Requirements:**
> - SSH access to the remote server
> - Git installed on the remote server
> - For agent auth: SSH agent running with your key loaded (`ssh-add -l`)
>
> See the [remote development notes](./agents/workflows/remote-development.md) for implementation details.
